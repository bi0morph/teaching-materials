# Object-Oriented JavaScript

Slides and materials are hosted [here](http://teaching-materials.org/jsoo).

## Course description

In this workshop, you'll learn the principles of Object-Oriented programming
and how you can apply those principles in JavaScript to architect your code better.
Understanding that will help your code as it gets larger, and is a crucial skill
for using JS in a large codebase, like at a company.

The workshop will be a mix of lectures and hands-on exercises in pairs, and will be taught by [teacher X, tiny bio]. This is a great follow-up workshop for those who have attended our JS intro workshop.
